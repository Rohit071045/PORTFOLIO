            <h3>Data Analyst!</h3>
            <p> Hi there! I’m Rohit Raj, a dedicated and detail-oriented Data Analyst with a passion for uncovering insights from data and turning them into actionable strategies. Currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science at Chandigarh University, I’ve cultivated a strong foundation in data analytics, machine learning, and business intelligence tools.;
                My journey in data began with a curiosity to understand patterns and solve real-world problems. Over the years, I’ve honed my skills through certifications like IBM Data Analytics, Meta Data Analytics, and Microsoft Power BI, and through practical experience with tools like SQL, Python, Power BI, Snowflake, and AWS Cloud Services.
                What I Do
                Create interactive dashboards that visualize complex data in a user-friendly way.
                Conduct in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and insights.
                Design and implement machine learning models for predictive analytics.
                Optimize workflows and automate tasks to improve efficiency.</p><br>
                Why Data?
                I believe data tells stories. With the right tools and techniques, we can unlock its potential to drive informed decision-making and innovation. From building dashboards that reduce manual reporting by 20% to delivering insights that improve business outcomes, I’m passionate about making a tangible impact through data.
                
                Beyond Work
